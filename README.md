Quaternion Julia Set Rendering, in Clojure
------------------------------------------

I've seen some Clojure examples of fractals (e.g. http://nakkaya.com/2009/10/04/fractals-in-clojure-buddhabrot-fractal/), but none of the quaternion Julia set. 
So here we are.

This project is a fairly minimal implementation of two ray-marching algorithms for rendering 3D slices of the (4D) quaternion Julia set.
The renders are lit with a very simple Blinn-Phong implementation.
